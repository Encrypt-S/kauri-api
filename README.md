## NavPi 2.0 Kowhai

![](./img/stakebox.jpg)

This is the official github repository for the NavPi 2.0 Kowhai project, the next generation of the NAVCoin Stake Box.

Due to the success of the original NavPi 1.0 project, NavCore have decided to fully re-engineer the NavPi from the ground up to make it even better and easier to use.

This software will turn your Raspberry Pi into a low cost and convenient way to earn Proof of Stake rewards.
