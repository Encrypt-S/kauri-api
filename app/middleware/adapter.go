// existing http.Handler is passed in and the Adapter will adapt it
// and return a new (wrapped) http.Handler to use in its place
// To make the adapters run in the order in which they are specified
// you could reverse through them in the Adapt function
// in essence, this middleware allows us to run code before
// and/or after our handler code in a HTTP request lifecycle

// Adapt function iterates over all adapters
// calling them one by one (in reverse order) in a chained manner
// returning the result of the first adapter.
